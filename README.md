# Rough Redesigns Sketches
https://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-informatics/

#### Design #1
Focus: Reduce information overload and present information in a more digestible format

#### Design #2
Focus: Create a more streamlined design, by introducing sectionalized information. The idea is to guide the visitor
and increase information visibility.

#### Design #3
Focus: Blend between design 1 and 2. The idea is we sacrifice some simplicty in exchange for more information available
in the main page in order to reduce the amount of links the visitor must visit to find their desired info.
